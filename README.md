Hi, welcome to my Quake 2 Rougelike Mod!
In this mod, it will make Quake 2 into more of a Rougelike game, where the maps will be randomized, weapon stats are also randomized, there will be
extra bonus items to some weapons, new items, and a way to keep track of any achievements.

There is nothing special about the controls, works the same as the base game.

After starting the game, the map that is loaded will be random, and each subsequent map is going to be different.
After spawing in, the stats of the starting weapon and all other weapons will have random stats.
The current stats that will be changed, will be the fire rate and damage

Bonus Weapon Items:
- Full Ammo - Refills all ammo types to max capacity
- Gun-ho - Gives player unlimited ammo, invulnerability, and quad damage for 30 sec
- Explosive Rounds - For a limited time, all shots fired will be turned into rockets
- Splash Damage - Makes all bullet types do splash damage to enemies in a certain range for 30 sec
- Stun - Shots will freeze enemies in their place for a 30 sec

Items:
- Extra Chance - Gives the player an extra life, where after death, the player can be revived with full health and armor
- Speed Up - Speeds up the player's movement speed for 30 sec
- Invulnerability Plus - Will make the player not take damage from anything for 30 sec
- Invisibility - Will make the player invisible to enemies for 30 sec
